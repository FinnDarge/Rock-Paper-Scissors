# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Second Project from Udacitys Intro To Programming Nanodegree

In this project I had to apply my Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors. The goal was to build classes that represent the game and its players that follow various different strategies. There was also a need for a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.
